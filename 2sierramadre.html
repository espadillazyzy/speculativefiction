            <h1>"PART 1:THE FALL OF SIERRA MADRE"</h1>
            <p>The Sierra Madre Mountain Range, known as the "Backbone of Luzon" had always been the Philippines natural barrier for typhoons. It stood tall and strong, breaking typhoon winds before they reached the lowlands, reducing the typhoons' impact and saving lives. But one day, greedy investors bought the land. Slowly, the green forests were replaced with roads and houses, transforming it into the largest subdivision in the country.
            <br><br>At first, people were happy. Many families finally had homes, and businesses started booming in the area. However, no matter how some environmentalists and thousands of protesters warned about the effect of flattening and cutting down the Sierra Madre people would'nt care. Without it, typhoons would hit Luzon harder than ever. People ignored the warnings, thinking it was just talk.</p>
