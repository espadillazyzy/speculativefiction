            <h1>"PART 2: THE RAGING STORM"</h1>
            <p>The super typhoon arrived. Winds blew at 300 km/h, with heavy rains flooding towns and cities. Without Sierra Madre, there was nothing to weaken the storm. Roofs flew, buildings crumbled, and entire communities were swept away by floods and landslides. Even the new subdivision was not spared; its houses were destroyed, and its residents were left stranded and helpless.
            <br><br>The government struggled to respond as roads were blocked, communication lines were down, and rescue efforts were delayed. People realized too late that Sierra Madre wasnâ€™t just a mountain range, it was a protector.</p>
