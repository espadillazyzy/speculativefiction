                  <h1>"WHEN THE SHIELD FALLS"</h1>
                  <p>A massive super typhoon with peak winds reaching up to 300km/h and expected to be more devastating than the typhoon Yolanda is about to hit the Philippines, specifically heading northeast down to the southwest of Luzon. With the Sierra Madre Mountain Range sold to greedy investors flattened to be the largest subdivision for millions of Filipino, is obviously a major downfall, an exchange loss not just for the country's economy but also for the lives of it's people.
                  <br><br>What would happen if the Sierra Madre Mountain Range is turned into the largest subdivision in the Philippines? How would it affect the country?</p>
