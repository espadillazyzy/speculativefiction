                  <p>When the storm passed, the destruction was unimaginable. Millions were left homeless, and many lives were lost. The cost of rebuilding was enormous, and the economy suffered greatly. People regretted trading nature for profit.
                  <br><br>The flat land where the Sierra Madre once stood could not be restored. Floods became more frequent, and typhoons were more destructive. People now understood the importance of protecting nature, but it was too late to bring back the Sierra Madre.</p>
